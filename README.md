# Schmerzmittelrechner (Pain Killer Calculator)

Schmerzmittelrechner is a Python-based tool that helps users calculate the remaining daily dose of common over-the-counter painkillers like Ibuprofen, Paracetamol, and Aspirin. The application is built using Streamlit for the user interface, and it leverages a custom class Dosage to handle dosage calculations based on user inputs.

As this project is currently work in progress only dummy values are used for the calculations.
